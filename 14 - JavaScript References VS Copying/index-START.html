    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let str = '123'; let num= 3; let bool = false;
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let players2 = players
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    players2.push(5)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players2)
    console.log(players)
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
     let playes3 = players.slice()
     playes3.push(7)
     console.log(playes3)
     console.log(players)
     console.log(players2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players4 = [].concat(players)
    players4.push(8)
    console.log('players4',players4)
    console.log(playes3)
     console.log(players)
     console.log(players2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players5 = [...players]
    players5.push(9)
    console.log('players5',players5)
    console.log(players)
    let arr6 = Array.from(players)
    arr6.push(9)
    console.log('arr6',arr6)
    console.log(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let person2 = {...person};
    person2.job = 'seller';
    console.log('person2',person2)
    console.log('person',person)
    let person3 = Object.assign({},person);
    person3.job = 'seller';
    console.log('person3',person3)
    console.log('person',person)
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
